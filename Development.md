## 개발환경 가상화

개발환경에 Docker 등을 활용한 가상화를 해야 하는 이유는 [VSCode Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) 가이드에 잘 나와 있다.

> * Develop on the same operating system you deploy to or use larger or more specialized hardware.
> * Separate your development environment to avoid impacting your local machine configuration.
> * Make it easy for new contributors to get started and keep everyone on a consistent environment.
> * Use tools or runtimes not available on your local OS or manage multiple versions of them.
> * Develop your Linux-deployed applications using the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
> * Access an existing development environment from multiple machines or locations.
> * Debug an application running somewhere else such as a customer site or in the cloud.
